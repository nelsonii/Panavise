# Panavise
Some useful add-ons for Panavise vises.

Replacement jaws for one of my vises. I have the Panavise PCB ones, but these are for their 300 series.

The thin overhanding board slots make a bigger difference than you'd think. Give you plenty of clearance to solder, yet still secure. This design has saved me a lot of time when soldering to Arduino Pro Micros / Leonardos.
